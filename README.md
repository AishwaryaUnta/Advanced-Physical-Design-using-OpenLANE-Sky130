# OpenLANE Overview
OpenLANE is an complete automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several blocks including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

16 Mask CMOS Process:

Substrate Selection is the base layer on which other regions will be formed.</p>
SiO2 and Si3N2 deposited. Photoresist is spinned. Pockets created using lithography process using masks.</p>
Nwell & Pwell formation took place and Gate terminal was created</p>
LDD was carried out to avoid hot electron effect and short channel effect.</p>
Source and Drain formation took place.</p>
Contacts & local interconnect were created.</p>
Higher Level metal layer formation took place.</p>
Here 16 masks were used at various stages throughout the process.</p>
